## Deep Learning model for Kaggle competition on Mechanism of Action of Drugs
The task of these competition is to develope a multi-label classification model to be able to classify the mechanisim of action of drugs used in the experiment in different doses and times. There are 206 mechanisms listed in the target dataframe. The Features dataframe consists of gene expresion values, as well as cell viability measures. 
The deep learning model developed here is able to classify the treatments into multiple classes with a 93% accuracy.
The data and the description are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa)
